### Hi there 👋

<img align="right" width=41% src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/926537/screenshots/4502924/python-2.gif" />


I'm a full-stack software developer with experience building apps using React/Redux, Ruby on Rails, and JavaScript. Before learning to code, my background was in data analysis and digital marketing, where my role as a technical problem solver and effective cross-team communicator allowed me to transition into software engineering.

When I'm not programming, I'm likely running 🏃, cooking 🍳, or looking after my rooftop garden 🌱.

Check out my projects:

- [Product Fish](https://github.com/kirbyneaton/product_hunt_clone) (Product Hunt clone) 🐟
- [Ride the Bull](https://github.com/kirbyneaton/stock_market_game) 📈
- [Unshelvd](https://github.com/kirbyneaton/Unshelved_MERN) 🎲
